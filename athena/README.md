Athena Python Package
=====================

This Python package provides tools for testing and using the
[Fireworks](https://pythonhosted.org/FireWorks/index.html) workflow
management suite's Python API on resources at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing
Facility.

The module `athena.py` provides API functionality missing in Fireworks v1.04 for
recovering offline jobs without invoking the suite's CLI scripts.

The module `example.py` provides a script for setting up an example
'Fireworks.Workflow' object and synchronizing it with a remote database.
